 CLI Application (Command-Line Interface)
The project also includes a CLI-based frontend that interacts with the backend REST APIs to provide a simple and user-friendly terminal interface for managing users and tasks.

üîå Backend Integration
The CLI application uses Java to connect with the Spring Boot backend using HTTP requests (e.g., via HttpURLConnection, RestTemplate, or similar Java HTTP client).

Menu Options
Upon running the CLI, you will see the following options:
